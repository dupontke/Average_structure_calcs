# ATOM SELECTION PARAMETERS

# AVERAGING PARAMETERS
thresh = 1E-5		# float value that determines the threshold for convergence of the iterative averaging process
maxIter = 100		# int value that determines the maximum number of iterations to be performed in the averaging process

# OUTPUT PARAMETERS
write_dcd = True		# Boolean value; if True, the script will print out the average structure to a DCD file format, which has more sig figs than a standard pdb format; use a DCD file for subsequent analyses that utilize an average structure
write_summary = True		# Boolean value; if True, the script will print out a summary file that breaks down the parameters used in the analysis and how to rerun the same analysis
write_overview = True		# Boolean value; if True, the script will append information to a file that will amass information about which trajectories and the number of steps being averaged over; this file is then used in the weighted averaging script to obtain an average structure of large number of steps.
